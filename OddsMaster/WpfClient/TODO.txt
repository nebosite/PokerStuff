	[x] Create an app model
	[x] Create a quiz model

	[ ] Better odds table
		[ ] Fix odds table to show betting threshholds
		[ ] Load the odds tables at program start
		[ ] Before calculating odds, fill in the betting profile	
			- base = 1/# of players
			- Strong = ratio > base * 1.3
			- regular = ratio > base
			- weak = ratio > base / 1.3

	[ ] Walk through the stages - Preflop, flop, turn, river
		[x] If incorrect, give a hint
		[x] If correct, say the percentage and lock the buttons
		[ ] Once a correct answer is given, enable a buttong to deal the next card(s)
		[ ] Color does not show up when button is disabled
		Dominating (1.1:1)
					90%
		Powerful (1.5:1)
					65%
		Strong (2:1)
					40%
		OK	(3:1)
					25%
		Risky (5:1)
					15%
		Weak	(10:1)
					5%
		Hopeless (20:1)
					0%
	[ ] Add Limp, bet, 2bet stages in between each
	[ ] In the explanation talk about why the percentage whent up or down.
		E.g.:  That 9 on the river just give a boost to a villian's straight potential
		[ ] Bonus question:  which type of hand accounted for the biggest part of the percentage change?  
			eg: player 3ok, villian straight, etc.

	[ ] Fix the button style to be perfect: https://gist.github.com/markheath/c8189790270b8615625d


	[ ] Track progress
		[ ] Points: 5 for first guess, then 2, then 1
		[ ] Remember total points for pocket type
		[ ] Remember performance at each stage

		    [ ] Instead of categories, click on a line and get:
        5 points if within a 4% window
        2 points if within a 12% window
        1 points if within a 30% window
        or new categories:
            0-8% hopeless
            6% - 20% risky
            15% - 40% strong
            35% - 80% poweful
            70% - 100% Dominating
            
	[ ] Game: "pickpocket" show a bunch of options for pockets - you pick the strongest

NEW
	[ ] Calculate win figures and compare to https://github.com/nebosite/PokerStuff.git
		- Everyone Stays to the end
		- Show a little status to show # runs and confidence
	[ ] If calculation is slow, always have a thread doing calculations ahead
	[ ] Bring in elements of poker play, which will adjust the odds at each stage
